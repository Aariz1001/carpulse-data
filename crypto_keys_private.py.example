🔐 EXAMPLE - Private Encryption Keys

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Copy this file to 'crypto_keys_private.py'
    2. Change the values below to your own unique secrets
    3. Make them look like innocuous config values (versions, build IDs, etc.)
    4. Update your app's decryption code with the SAME values
    5. Re-encrypt all data: python encrypt_data.py --verify
